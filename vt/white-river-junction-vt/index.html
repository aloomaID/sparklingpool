                <p>Preventing algae growth in your pool is essential for maintaining a clean and healthy swimming environment. At Spark Pool Cleaning, we understand the challenges of keeping your pool crystal clear, especially in White River Junction Vermont . Here are effective strategies to prevent algae from taking over your pool.<br>First and foremost, ensure proper water circulation. Algae thrives in stagnant water, so running your pool pump for at least 8 to 12 hours daily is crucial. This helps distribute chemicals evenly and prevents debris accumulation, which can foster algae growth.<br>Maintaining balanced water chemistry is another vital step. Regularly test and adjust the pH levels, alkalinity, and chlorine concentration in your pool. Ideal pH levels should range from 7.4 to 7.6, while chlorine levels should be between 1 and 3 ppm. Regular testing helps keep algae at bay and ensures a safe swimming environment.<br>Regular cleaning is also essential. Skim the surface for debris, brush the walls and floor, and vacuum the pool weekly. Removing organic matter prevents algae from finding a food source. Additionally, consider using algaecides as a preventive measure, especially during warmer months in White River Junction Vermont when algae are more likely to flourish.<br>Finally, ensure that your pool's filtration system is functioning efficiently. A well-maintained filter can remove algae spores and other contaminants, keeping your pool sparkling clean. By following these preventative measures, you can enjoy a beautiful, algae-free pool all season long. If you need assistance, don’t hesitate to contact Spark Pool Cleaning for expert help in White River Junction Vermont .</p>
