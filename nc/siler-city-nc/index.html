                <p>Preventing algae from growing in your pool is essential for maintaining a clean and safe swimming environment. At Spark Pool Cleaning, we understand the challenges of keeping your pool algae-free, especially in Siler City North Carolina where warm weather can promote rapid growth. Here are some effective strategies to help you prevent algae blooms in your pool.<br>First, ensure that your pool’s chemical levels are balanced. Regularly test the pH, alkalinity, and chlorine levels to keep them within the recommended ranges. Proper chemical balance not only sanitizes your pool but also creates an environment that is less hospitable to algae.<br>Second, maintain consistent circulation and filtration. Running your pool pump for at least 8-12 hours a day helps keep water moving, preventing stagnant areas where algae can thrive. Regularly clean or replace your pool filters to ensure they are functioning optimally.<br>Third, keep your pool clean by regularly brushing and vacuuming the surfaces. Remove debris, leaves, and organic matter that can contribute to algae growth. Additionally, consider using an algaecide as a preventive measure, especially during warmer months.<br>Lastly, cover your pool when not in use to minimize debris accumulation and block sunlight, which encourages algae growth. By implementing these simple yet effective strategies, you can enjoy a beautiful, algae-free pool all season long.

They had met aboard the Two Sisters, a ship from Germany. The ship landed in Philadelphia, where Plikard paid leaf tobacco to marry Elizabeth. The couple briefly lived in Pennsylvania, then Virginia, and then settled near Lacy's Creek (the location near today's Siler City). They had ten children.</p>
